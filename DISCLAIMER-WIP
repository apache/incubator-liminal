Apache Liminal is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC.

Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness
or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be
fully endorsed by the ASF.

Some of the incubating projectâ€™s releases may not be fully compliant with ASF policy.
For example, releases may have incomplete or un-reviewed licensing conditions.
What follows is a list of known issues the project is currently aware of
(note that this list, by definition, is likely to be incomplete):

1. The Liminal source code is distributed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. However
building Liminal requires using a transitive required library chardet V 4.0.0, which is under LGPL license, Version 2.1.

If you are planning to incorporate this work into your product/project,
please be aware that you will need to conduct a thorough licensing review
to determine the overall implications of including this work.
