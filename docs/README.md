# Apache Liminal

Apache Liminal is an end-to-end platform for data engineers & scientists, allowing them to build,
train and deploy machine learning models in a robust and agile way.

The platform provides the abstractions and declarative capabilities for
data extraction & feature engineering followed by model training and serving.
Liminal's goal is to operationalize the machine learning process, allowing data scientists to
quickly transition from a successful experiment to an automated pipeline of model training,
validation, deployment and inference in production, freeing them from engineering and
non-functional tasks, and allowing them to focus on machine learning code and artifacts.

## Basics

Using simple YAML configuration, create your own schedule data pipelines (a sequence of tasks to
perform), application servers,  and more.

## Getting Started
A simple hello world guide for Liminal can be found [here](getting-started/hello_world.md) \
A more advanced example which demonstrates a simple data-science workflow can be found [here](getting-started/iris_classification.md
