Images
======

In the ``images`` section you can configure how to pack your code into docker images. This can be
achieved in liminal easily, without any Docker knowledge needed by setting just a few attributes:

.. code-block:: yaml

   images:
     - image: myorg/myrepo:mypythonapp
       type: python
       source: .
     - image: myorg/myrepo:myserver
       type: python_server
       source: path/to/my/server/code
       endpoints:
         - endpoint: /myendpoint
           module: my_module
..

``images`` is a section in the root lof your liminal.yml file and is a list of
``image`` s, defined by the following attributes:

image attributes
''''''''''''''''

``image``: name of your image, usually will be in the form of ``user/repository:tag`` common in
docker image repositories such as Docker Hub, but for local development this can be any string.

``type``: type of the image. Usually this will match your coding language, or your coding langauge
followed by an ``_`` and a specific style of application (such as a server).

``source``: location of source files to include in the image, this can be a relative path within
your project, or even ``.`` which means the entire project should be packaged in the image.

``build_cmd``: certain languages require to be built or compiled, here you can provide your build
command to be executed in order to build your code.

Other image types might require additional configuration, for example, servers require ``endpoints``
to be configured.
