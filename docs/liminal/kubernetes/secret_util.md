# Secret Utils

Each `task` in your pipelines has a reference to an secret from the `secrets` section of your
liminal.yml file.

```yaml
---
name: k8s_secret_example
secrets:
  - secret: aws
    remote_path: "/secrets"
    local_path_file: "~/.aws/credentials"
executors:
  - executor: k8s
    type: kubernetes
variables:
  AWS_CONFIG_FILE: /mnt/credentials
task_defaults:
  python:
    executor: k8s
    image: amazon/aws-cli:2.7.23
    executors: 2
    env_vars:
      AWS_CONFIG_FILE: "/secrets/credentials"
      AWS_PROFILE: "default"
    secrets:
      - secret: aws
    mounts:
      - mount: myaws-creds
        volume: aws
        path: /mnt/
pipelines:
  - pipeline: k8s_secret_example
    owner: Bosco Albert Baracus
    start_date: 1970-01-01
    timeout_minutes: 10
    schedule: 0 * 1 * *
    tasks:
      - task: my_python_task
        type: python
        cmd: aws s3 ls
```

That example manifest defines a Secret Opaque for AWS credentials used. The values are Base64 strings in the manifest; however, when you use the Secret with a Pod then the kubelet provides the decoded data to the Pod and its containers.

In order to make use of the AWS credentials we define an environment variable `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` to authenticate our requests.

For example, the files generated by the AWS CLI for a default profile configured with aws configure looks similar to the following.

`~/.aws/credentials`
```
[default]
aws_access_key_id=<aws_access_key_id>
aws_secret_access_key=<aws_secret_access_key>
region = us-east-1
aws_session_token=<aws_session_token>
```
