In this tutorial, we will guide you through setting up Apache Liminal on your local machine and run
a simple machine-learning workflow, based on the classic Iris dataset classification example
including a feature engineering with Spark engine. \
More details in
this [link](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html).

#### Prerequisites

* [Python 3 (3.6 and up)](https://www.python.org/downloads)
* [Python Virtual Environments](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* [Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos)

*Note: Make sure kubernetes cluster is running in docker desktop*

## Setup your local env environment

In the dev folder, clone the example code from liminal:

```BASH
git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-liminal
```

***Note:*** *You just cloned the entire Liminal Project, you actually only need examples folder.*

Create a python virtual environment to isolate your runs:

```BASH
cd incubator-liminal/examples/spark-app-demo/
python3 -m venv env
```

Activate your virtual environment:

```BASH
source env/bin/activate
```

Now we are ready to install liminal:

```BASH
pip install apache-liminal
```

## Spark On K8S

We will define the following steps and services to implement the Iris classification example
including a simple feature engineering with Apache Spark: \
Clean data, Train, Validate & Deploy - Cleaning the input data set and prepare it for training and
validation execution is managed by Liminal Airflow extension. The training task trains a regression
model using a public dataset. \
We then validate the model and deploy it to a model-store in mounted volume. \
Inference - online inference is done using a Python Flask service running on the local Kubernetes in
docker desktop. The service exposes the `/predict` endpoint. It reads the model stored in the
mounted drive and uses it to evaluate the request.

### Setup liminal

```BASH
cd incubator-liminal/examples/spark-app-demo/k8s
```

#### Liminal build

The build will create docker images based on the liminal.yml file in the `images` section.

```BASH
liminal build
```

#### Liminal create

All tasks use a mounted volume as defined in the pipeline YAML. \
In our case the mounted volume will point to the liminal Iris Classification example. The training
task trains a regression model using a public dataset. We then validate the model and deploy it to a
model-store in the mounted volume.

Create a kubernetes local volume:

```BASH
liminal create
```

#### Liminal deploy

The deploy command deploys a liminal server and deploys any liminal.yml files in your working
directory or any of its subdirectories to your liminal home directory.

```BASH
liminal deploy --clean
```

*Note: liminal home directory is located in the path defined in LIMINAL_HOME env variable. If the
LIMINAL_HOME environemnet variable is not defined, home directory defaults to
~/liminal_home directory.*

#### Liminal start

The start command spins up 3 containers that load the Apache Airflow stack. Liminal's Airflow
extension is responsible to execute the workflows defined in the liminal.yml file as standard
Airflow DAGs.

```BASH
liminal start
```

You can go to graph view to see all the tasks configured in the liminal.yml file:
[http://localhost:8080/admin/airflow/graph?dag_id=my_first_spark_pipeline](
http://localhost:8080/admin/airflow/graph?dag_id=my_first_spark_pipeline
)

You should see the following dag:

### Liminal YAML walkthrough

* [Local archetype](#Local-archetype)
* [Pipeline flow](#Pipeline-flow)

#### Local archetype

A superliminal for an easy local development

```YAML
name: InfraSpark
owner: Bosco Albert Baracus
type: super
executors:
  - executor: k8s
    type: kubernetes
variables:
  output_root_dir: /mnt/gettingstartedvol
  input_root_dir: ''
images:
  - image: my_spark_image
    type: spark
    source: .
    no_cache: True
task_defaults:
  spark:
    executor: k8s
    executors: 2
    application_source: '{{application}}'
    mounts:
      - mount: mymount
        volume: gettingstartedvol
        path: /mnt/gettingstartedvol
```

###### We specify the `MOUNT_PATH` in which we store the trained model.

You can read more about `superliminal` `variables` and `defaults`
in [advanced.liminal.yml](../liminal/advanced.liminal.yml.md)

#### Pipeline flow

Declaration of the pipeline tasks flow in your liminal YAML:

```YAML
name: MyFirstLiminalSparkApp
super: InfraSpark
owner: Bosco Albert Baracus
variables:
  output_path: '{{output_root_dir}}/my_first_liminal_spark_app_outputs/'
  application: data_cleanup.py
task_defaults:
  python:
    mounts:
      - mount: mymount
        volume: gettingstartedvol
        path: /mnt/gettingstartedvol
pipelines:
  - pipeline: my_first_spark_pipeline
    start_date: 1970-01-01
    timeout_minutes: 45
    schedule: 0 * 1 * *
    tasks:
      - task: data_preprocessing
        type: spark
        description: prepare the data for training
        application_arguments:
          - '{{input_root_dir}}data/iris.csv'
          - '{{output_path}}'
      - task: train
        type: python
        description: train model
        image: myorg/mydatascienceapp
        cmd: python -u training.py train '{{output_path}}'
        env:
          MOUNT_PATH: /mnt/gettingstartedvol
        ...
```

### Evaluate the iris classification model

Once the Iris Classification model trainging is completed and model is deployed (to the mounted
volume), you can launch a pod of the pre-built image which contains a flask server, by applying the
following Kubernetes manifest configuration:

```BASH
kubectl apply -f manifests/spark-app-demo.yaml
```

Alternatively, create a Kubernetes pod from stdin:

```YAML
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: spark-app-demo
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: task-pv-storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: gettingstartedvol-pvc
  containers:
    - name: task-pv-container
      imagePullPolicy: Never
      image: myorg/mydatascienceapp
      lifecycle:
        postStart:
          exec:
            command: [ "/bin/bash", "-c", "apt update && apt install curl -y" ]
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: "http-server"
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/mnt/gettingstartedvol"
          name: task-pv-storage
EOF
```

Check that the service is running:

```BASH
kubectl get pods --namespace=default
```

Check that the service is up:

```BASH
kubectl exec -it --namespace=default spark-app-demo -- /bin/bash -c "curl localhost/healthcheck"
```

Check the prediction:

```BASH
kubectl exec -it --namespace=default spark-app-demo -- /bin/bash -c "curl -X POST -d '{\"petal_width\": [1.1,1.1,1.1,1.1]}' localhost/predict"
```

## Debugging Kubernetes Deployments

kubectl get pods will help you check your pod status:

```BASH
kubectl get pods --namespace=default
```

kubectl logs will help you check your pods log:

```BASH
kubectl logs --namespace=default spark-app-demo
```

kubectl exec to get a shell to a running container:

```BASH
kubectl exec --namespace=default spark-app-demo -- bash
```

Then you can check the mounted volume `df -h` and to verify the result of the model.

You can go to graph view to see all the tasks configured in the liminal.yml file:
[http://localhost:8080/admin/airflow/graph?dag_id=my_first_pipeline](
http://localhost:8080/admin/airflow/graph?dag_id=my_first_pipeline

## Here are the entire list of commands, if you want to start from scratch:

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-liminal
cd examples/spark-app-demo/k8s
# cd examples/spark-app-demo/emr
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
rm -rf ~/liminal_home
pip uninstall apache-liminal
pip install apache-liminal
Liminal build
Liminal create
liminal deploy --clean
liminal start
```

## Closing up

To make sure liminal containers are stopped use:

```
liminal stop
```

To deactivate the python virtual env use:

```
deactivate
```

To terminate the kubernetes pod:

```
kubectl delete pod --namespace=default spark-app-demo
```
