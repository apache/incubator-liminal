# Liminal

Liminal is an end-to-end platform for data engineers & scientists, allowing them to build, train and deploy machine learning models in a robust and agile way. The platform provides the abstractions and declarative capabilities for data extraction & feature engineering followed by model training and serving. Apache Liminal's goal is to operationalise the machine learning process, allowing data scientists to quickly transition from a successful experiment to an automated pipeline of model training, validation, deployment and inference in production, freeing them from engineering and non-functional tasks, and allowing them to focus on machine learning code and artifacts.

## Motivation

The challenges involved in operationalizing machine learning models are one of the main reasons why many machine learning projects never make it to production.
The process involves automating and orchestrating multiple steps which run on heterogeneous infrastructure - different compute environments, data processing platforms, ML frameworks, notebooks, containers and monitoring tools.
There are no mature standards for this workflow, and most organizations do not have the experience to build it in-house. In the best case, dev-ds-devops teams form in order to accomplish this task together; in many cases, it's the data scientists who try to deal with this themselves without the knowledge or the inclination to become infrastructure experts.
As a result, many projects never make it through the cycle. Those who do suffer from a very long lead time from a successful experiment to an operational, refreshable, deployed and monitored model in production.
The goal of Apache Liminal is to simplify the creation and management of machine learning pipelines by data engineers & scientists. The platform provides declarative building blocks which define the workflow, orchestrate the underlying infrastructure,  take care of non functional concerns, enabling focus in business logic / algorithm code.
Some Commercial E2E solutions have started to emerge in the last few years, however, they are limited to specific parts of the workflow, such as Databricks MLFlow. Other solutions are tied to specific environments (e.g. SageMaker on AWS).

## High Level Architecture
The platform is aimed to provide data engineers & scientists with a solution for end to end flows from model training to real time inference in production. It’s architecture enables and promotes adoption of specific components in existing (non-Liminal) frameworks, as well as seamless integration with other open source projects. Liminal was created to enable scalability in ML efforts and after a thorough review of available solutions and frameworks, which did not meet our main KPIs:
Provide an opinionated but customizable end-to-end workflow
Abstract away the complexity of underlying infrastructure
Support major open source tools and cloud-native infrastructure to carry out many of the steps
Allow teams to leverage their existing investments or bring in their tools of choice into the workflow
We have found that other tech companies in the Israeli Hi-Tech ecosystem also have an interest in such a platform, hence decided to share our work with the community.
The following diagram depicts these main components and where Apache Liminal comes in:

A classical data scientist workflow includes some base phases:
_Train, Deploy and Consume._

**The Train phase includes the following tasks:**

1. Fetch -  get the data needed to build a model - usually using SQL
1. Clean - make sure the data is useful for building the model
1. Prepare - split data and encode features from the data according to model needs
1. Train - Build the model and tune it
1. Evaluate - make sure the model is correct - run it on a test set, etc…
1. Validate - make sure the model is up to the standards you need

**The Deploy phase includes these tasks:**
1. Deploy - make it available for usage in production
1. Inference - Batch or Real-time - use the model to evaluate data by your offline or online by your applications
1. Consume - The actual use of the models created by applications and ETLs, usually through APIs to the batch or real-time inference that usually rely on Model and Feature stores.

Liminal provides its users a declarative composition capabilities to materialize these steps in a robust way, while exploiting existing frameworks and tools. e.g. Data science frameworks such as scikit-learn, Tensor flow, Keras and such, for running core data science algorithms; as numerous core mechanisms as data stores, processing engines, parallelism, schedulers, code deployment as well as batch and real-time inference.
Liminal allows the creation and wiring of these kinds of functional and non functional tasks while making the underlying infrastructure used by these tasks very easy to use and even abstracted away entirely. While handling the non-functional aspects as monitoring (in a standard fashion) deployment, scheduling, resource management and execution.
